This project introduces a compact, palm-sized, remote-controlled vehicle (RCV) that operates on a 47 MHz radio frequency. The primary goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of a miniature RCV with advanced network disruption capabilities.

Key Features:

  Miniaturization: The RCV is designed to be incredibly compact, making it portable and easy to operate.
  47 MHz Radio Frequency: This frequency band is commonly used for RC vehicles, ensuring reliable communication between the controller and the vehicle.
  Advanced Network Disruption: The RCV incorporates a versatile wireless network attack toolkit, enabling it to perform:
      De-authentication Attacks: Disrupts active WiFi sessions by sending spoofed de-authentication frames.
      Beacon Flooding Attacks: Overwhelms wireless networks with fake access points, causing interference and denial of service.
      Probe Request Flooding Attacks: Identifies vulnerable devices on a network by sending a large number of probe requests.
Potential Applications:

While the primary purpose of this project is educational and experimental, it highlights the potential for developing sophisticated, miniature RC vehicles with advanced network security testing capabilities.

Note: It's crucial to use such devices responsibly and ethically. Unauthorized network attacks are illegal and can have serious consequences. This project is intended for educational purposes and to raise awareness about potential vulnerabilities in wireless networks.
