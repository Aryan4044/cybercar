This project introduces a compact, palm-sized, remote-controlled vehicle (RCV) that operates on a 47 MHz radio frequency. The primary goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of a miniature RCV with advanced network disruption capabilities.

Key Features:

  Miniaturization: The RCV is designed to be incredibly compact, making it portable and easy to operate.
  
  47 MHz Radio Frequency: This frequency band is commonly used for RC vehicles, ensuring reliable communication between the controller and the vehicle.
  
  Advanced Network Disruption: The RCV incorporates a versatile wireless network attack toolkit, enabling it to perform:
      De-authentication Attacks: Disrupts active WiFi sessions by sending spoofed de-authentication frames.
      Beacon Flooding Attacks: Overwhelms wireless networks with fake access points, causing interference and denial of service.
      Probe Request Flooding Attacks: Identifies vulnerable devices on a network by sending a large number of probe requests.
      
Potential Applications:

While the primary purpose of this project is educational and experimental, it highlights the potential for developing sophisticated, miniature RC vehicles with advanced network security testing capabilities.

Note: It's crucial to use such devices responsibly and ethically. Unauthorized network attacks are illegal and can have serious consequences. This project is intended for educational purposes and to raise awareness about potential vulnerabilities in wireless networks.


Lets get started with making 


first of all you can flash your node mcu by 2 methods 
you can use source code or you can directly use binary (.bin file)
ill reccomend to go with .bin file as it is easy for use 
IMPORTANT :- this code is made/tested on node mcu esp 8266 V2 ! if you have latest version or (current v3 ) you might face some errors 



the next step is to wire up your node mcu and all electroncis (battery,bms,transmitter,rc controller,voltage stablizer/booster,moters and node mcu which is the heart of this project)
you can reffer the diagram bilow :-

next step youll have to do the same with rc -transmitter and audio reciever !
here's a diagram for that :-

and you are all set ! 
place these components and you are good to go here !!
